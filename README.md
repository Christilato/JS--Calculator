# JS--Calculator
A beginner follow along video building a calculator with Vanilla Javascript

Things Learned: defered in the script on html will make sure the script comes up parallel with parsing the page, otherwise there could be some errors 
disable input on the calculator so it cannot be manually entered & computer generated answers only 

shortcuts: typing in htlm buttom.operator will create a dive formaula with operator as the class, shift option and down button to copy multiple rows below of the same

Great practice for jumoung into containeers and the grid system for layout
