# JS--Calculator
A beginner follow along video building a calculator with Vanilla Javascript. 

## Follow Along Thoughts
I find follow along videos great for showing me the proper way to code and the proper way to think about the solutions. 

The step by step breakdown of all the different functional elements was thorough. I have a greater understanding of Vanilla Javascript and the step by step thought of how to display elements & get them to function. This video specifically enlarged my knowledge with containers and grid elements.

The CSS files use alot of grid variations & I learned more ways to utilize it. 

This video was also a great way to learn the math functions in Vanilla Javascript. Our computers are capable of so much, we just need to know how to communicate properly. 

New Things Learned: 
1. When creating HTML file we added defered in the script on html will make sure the script comes up parallel with parsing the page, otherwise there could be some errors 
disable input on the calculator so it cannot be manually entered & computer generated answers only. 
2. Typing in the index file "button.operator" will create a button with with operator as the class. This goes for all other elements with class (.) & id (#) 
3. Shift option and down button on mac used to copy multiple rows below of the same
